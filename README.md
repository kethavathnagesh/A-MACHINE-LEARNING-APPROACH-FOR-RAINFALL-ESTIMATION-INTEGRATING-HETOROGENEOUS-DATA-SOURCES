# A-MACHINE-LEARNING-APPROACH-FOR-RAINFALL-ESTIMATION-INTEGRATING-HETOROGENEOUS-DATA-SOURCES
 This project integrates diverse data sources (weather radar, satellite imagery, ground-based observations) using machine learning for accurate rainfall estimation. It overcomes limitations of individual sources, improving applications in agriculture, hydrology, and disaster management.
